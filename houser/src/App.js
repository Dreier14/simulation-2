I could stick around and get along with you, hello.
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you, hello.
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party.
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you get from me, hey.
Yeah I think you're cute, but really you should know.
I just came to say <div id = "box3">
<h1><a href = "https://www.google.com/">GOOGLE</a></h1>
<ol><li> Hello</li>
<li> Goodbye</li>
<li>Farewell</li> </ol>
